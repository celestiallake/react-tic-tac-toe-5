# react-tic-tac-toe-5

This repository exists as the code sample and isn't intended to be
anything more than that. It's the game of tic-tac-toe, more specifically,
its 5-in-a-row variation. It features some fairly smooth visuals and
classically simple game mechanics, as well as the win resolution algorhitm,
worst and best scenarios of which are resolved in constant time for any
arbitrary field size.

_NOTE: Project is lazy WIP and I will occasionally append some neat features
every aeon passing by. Enjoy if you will!_
